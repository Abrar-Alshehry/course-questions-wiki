[Course Textbook Chapter 7, Problem 3]
- Question (akumar30−stat6250):  What is the maximum length of format-name defined as VALUE format-name?
- Answer (akumar30−stat6250):  It varies on SAS Version and type of format-name. In SAS 8.2 maximum length will be up to eight characters only. But in SAS 9 onwards, a numeric format name can be up to 32 characters in length and character format name can be up to 31 characters in length. 
- Question (mcardoso3-stat6250):  What is considered to be a VALUE statement when creating a format in Escape?
- Answer (mcardoso3-stat6250): A VALUE in SAS can be any set of numbers or letter characters that are enclosed in quotation marks, not a combination of letters and numbers nor any special characters (@,#,$).
- Question (dlee117−stat6250): What is the general form of the VALUE statement?
- Question (rluo-stat6250): What format catalog would be stored if we do not specify the LIBRARY = option?

- Question (mcardoso3-stat6250):  What is the purpose of using a PROC FORMAT statement in SAS?
- Answer (mcardoso3-stat6250):  PROC FORMAT statements are used to create a catalog of all formats in SAS, or to be stored in an existing format catalog under the SAS library.
- Question (dlee117−stat6250): When would you want to permanently associate a format with a variable?
- Question (rluo-stat6250): How to displays a list of all the formats in the catalog?
- Answer (rluo-stat6250): We can add the keyword FMTLIB to the PROC FORMAT statement.



[Course Textbook Chapter 8, Problem 1]
- Question (akumar30−stat6250): Can we get median and range as default statistics output of PROC MEANS statement?
- Answer (akumar30−stat6250):  No, you need to define MEDIAN and RANGE keywords in PROC MEANS statement to get the median and range of dataset.

- Question (dlee117−stat6250): What is the difference between the MEANS procedure and the SUMMARY procedure?

[Course Textbook Chapter 8, Problem 2]
- Question (akumar30−stat6250): How to limit decimal places in PROC MEANS statement?
- Answer (akumar30−stat6250):  using option MAXDEC=n; where n specifies the maximum number of decimal places.
- Question (mcardoso3-stat6250):  What is the difference between the "var" command and the "by" and "class" commands?
- Answer (mcardoso3-stat6250):  "var" is meant to analyze variables, while "class" and "by" are used for categorizing observations.
- Question (dlee117−stat6250): If you have a large amount of similar variables (designated by different numbers), what can you do to make the task of listing out all of these variables less tedious?
- Answer (dlee117-stat6250): Instead of listing variables separately, you can use a numbered range of variables (i.e. item1-item5 instead of item1, item2, item3, item4, and item5).
- Question (rluo-stat6250): How to limit decimal places?



[Course Textbook Chapter 8, Problem 4]

- Question (mcardoso3-stat6250):  What happens if data wasn't previously sorted before using PROC MEANS with a BY group and would everything need to be redone?
- Question (dlee117−stat6250): When would you use the BY statement and when would you use the CLASS statement?

[Course Textbook Chapter 8, Problem 7]
- Question (akumar30−stat6250):  Is prior sorting required for PROC FREQ statement?
- Question (mcardoso3-stat6250):  What other columns would be useful for analysis if added to the PROC FREQ tables besides frequency and percentages?
- Question (dlee117−stat6250): What is recommended that you use when you use a PROC FREQ statement?
- Question (rluo-stat6250): What kind of summary statistics are produced when you use the OUTPUT statement?



[Course Textbook Chapter 8, Problem 8]
- Question (akumar30−stat6250):  Which variables are most suitable for PROC FREQ Statements?
- Answer (akumar30−stat6250):  Frequency distributions work best with variables whose values can be described as categorical, and whose values are best summarized by counts rather than by averages.
- Question (mcardoso3-stat6250):  Why are categorical variables the best choice of variables for using PROC FREQ?
- Answer (mcardoso3-stat6250):  Categorical variables are the best option for using frequency distributions since numeric variables can be continous and therefore result in lengthy tables.  Unique values would also be unsuitable for PROC FREQ.
- Question (dlee117−stat6250): How do you determine the order that your variables are listed in the PROC FREQ report?
