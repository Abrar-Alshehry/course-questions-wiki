## Week 6 Quiz Questions and Answers

In order to prepare your Week 6 Quiz submission, please edit ***this*** document to provide substantive questions for each Quiz Problem and SAS Recipe listed below, as well as answers to at least three questions raised.

All edits should conform to GitHub Markdown specifications (https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) and should be committed to a branch named "week-6" in your fork of this repo. Then, after all edits have been made/committed, your Week 6 Quiz should be submitted by initiating a pull request using

- the master branch of the stat6250/course_questions_wiki repo as the base fork and

- the week-6 branch of your version of the repo as the head fork.

The instructor will then review the pull request and make comments should further revision be needed. Then, after the contents of the pull request have been finalized without any merge conflicts, the instructor will merge the pull request.

[Course Textbook Chapter 12, Problem 1]

* *Question (aalshehry−stat6250):* What is the right way to concatenate two datasets in a new one?
* *Answer (aalshehry−stat6250):* By using the following syntax: 
```SAS
DATA SAS-data-set;
       SET SAS-data-set1 SAS-data-set2 ...;
RUN;
```
- Question (yzhu12-stat6250): Why there is no end-of-file condition when you use direct access?



[Course Textbook Chapter 12, Problem 2]

* *Question (aalshehry−stat6250):* What is the main difference between using SET and Merge statements in DATA step?
- Question (yzhu12-stat6250): What steps you must take to prevent continuous looping while using direct access to read data?
- Answer (yzhu12-stat6250): You either add a STOP statement to the DATA step, or use programming logic that checks for an invalid value of the POINT= variable.

[Course Textbook Chapter 12, Problem 3]

* *Question (aalshehry−stat6250):* What is the default oreder of the output obsevations when SET statement is used to combine two datasets?
- Question (yzhu12-stat6250): How do we determine when the last observation in an input data set has been read?
- Answer (yzhu12-stat6250): We use the END= option in the SET statement.



[Course Textbook Chapter 12, Problem 4]

* *Question (aalshehry−stat6250):* Before concatenate datasets, what should we pay attention to?
* *Answer (aalshehry−stat6250):*  It is important to know the structure and contents of the input datasets by checking the describtive part and the data as well.
- Question (yzhu12-stat6250): How do you select the variables that you want to drop or keep?
- Answer (yzhu12-stat6250): You can use the DROP= and KEEP= data set options in parentheses after a SAS data set name.


[Course Textbook Chapter 12, Problem 5]

* *Question (aalshehry−stat6250):* What is the best way to combine multiple datasets which have a primar-key variable?
- Question (yzhu12-stat6250): When we read a single data set, which command do we use to specify the data set to be read?
- Answer (yzhu12-stat6250): We use SET statement.


[Course Textbook Chapter 12, Problem 7]

* *Question (aalshehry−stat6250):* In MERGE statement, what the possible values for IN option? and how it can be utilized?
* *Answer (aalshehry−stat6250):*  The IN= variables have two possible values: 0 and 1 which indicates whether a data set contributed information to the observation: MERGE SAS-data-set1 <(IN=variable)>...
- Question (yzhu12-stat6250): What's the other programming features for manipulation data sets that the DATA step can provide?
- Answer (yzhu12-stat6250): We can use IF-THEN/ELSE logic with DO groups and DO loops to control processing that is based on one or more conditions, specify additional data set options, process variables in arrays and use SAS functions.

[Course Textbook Chapter 12, Problem 9]

* *Question (aalshehry−stat6250):* What will happen if two datasets were combined with the same variable name but with different type?
- Question (yzhu12-stat6250): What's the BY statement in SAS for?


[basic_recipe_for_combining_data_horizontally (from Week 6 Overview)]

* *Question (aalshehry−stat6250):* Using Program Data Vector (PDV) has many advantages, but what are its disadvantages?
- Question (yzhu12-stat6250): For example, if we have a data set containing missing variables, how does the SAS combine the data sets horizontally and correctly, which means that the corresponding variables are sorted  and then combined horizontally?


[optional: adv_recipe_for_combining_data_horizontally (from Week 6 Overview)]

- Question (yzhu12-stat6250): What kind of error will occur if the order of these AS statements are converted improperly?
