## Week 5 Quiz Questions and Answers

In order to prepare your Week 5 Quiz submission, please edit ***this*** document to provide substantive questions for each Quiz Problem and SAS Recipe listed below, as well as answers to at least three questions raised.

All edits should conform to GitHub Markdown specifications (https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) and should be committed to a branch named "week-5" in your fork of this repo. Then, after all edits have been made/committed, your Week 5 Quiz should be submitted by initiating a pull request using

- the master branch of the stat6250/course_questions_wiki repo as the base fork and

- the week-5 branch of your version of the repo as the head fork.

The instructor will then review the pull request and make comments should further revision be needed. Then, after the contents of the pull request have been finalized without any merge conflicts, the instructor will merge the pull request.

[Course Textbook Chapter 5, Problem 1]
- Question (cyuan10−stat6250): Raw data files can be converted to SAS datasets. Can we also use filename statement to convert a SAS dataset into a different software file like excel?


[Course Textbook Chapter 5, Problem 2]
- Question (cyuan10−stat6250): How do we make filerefs permanent? 


[Course Textbook Chapter 5, Problem 6]
- Question (cyuan10−stat6250): How is the code format determined for the input line where we have 2 variables in the first line
then 2 more variables in the second line? Can we have all four in the same line or each individually? 
- Answer (cyuan10−stat6250): This was done for stylistic reasons. The line code ends with the semi-colon.


[Course Textbook Chapter 5, Problem 7]
- Question (cyuan10−stat6250): In the example, are ending "0" such as 33.990 the same as 33.99 read as the same in SAS?
- Answer (cyuan10−stat6250): Yes. These two values are equal.

[Course Textbook Chapter 5, Problem 8]
- Question (cyuan10−stat6250): Is there a difference in output if we use 2 vs. 2.00? Would our results end with decimals?


[Course Textbook Chapter 6, Problem 1]
- Question (cyuan10−stat6250): What can prevent or block the descriptors during the compilation phrase?
- Answer (cyuan10−stat6250): Syntax errors may prevent the compilation phrase from moving forward successfully.


[Course Textbook Chapter 6, Problem 2]
- Question (cyuan10−stat6250): Is there a memory limitation with the input buffer?



[Course Textbook Chapter 6, Problem 3]
- Question (cyuan10−stat6250): Can variables names be changed permanently in the data file as part of the the DATA step so that we're correctly issues with the file rather than the code?



[Course Textbook Chapter 6, Problem 4]
- Question (cyuan10−stat6250): Is there a way to add more "descriptors" to the Descriptor Portion beyond was is currently in the output?


[Course Textbook Chapter 6, Problem 5]
- Question (cyuan10−stat6250): Will ERRORS help us identify exactly how many errors there are in the Data step?


[Course Textbook Chapter 6, Problem 6]
- Question (cyuan10−stat6250): Why are ERROR and the program data vector reset to zero at the end of the data step? 



[basic_recipe_for_creating_analytic_datasets (from Week 5 Overview)]
- Question (cyuan10−stat6250): Can we create a single SAS data set from mulitple external raw data sets?
