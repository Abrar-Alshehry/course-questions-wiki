## Week 5 Quiz Questions and Answers

In order to prepare your Week 5 Quiz submission, please edit ***this*** document to provide substantive questions for each Quiz Problem and SAS Recipe listed below, as well as answers to at least three questions raised.

All edits should conform to GitHub Markdown specifications (https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) and should be committed to a branch named "week-5" in your fork of this repo. Then, after all edits have been made/committed, your Week 5 Quiz should be submitted by initiating a pull request using

- the master branch of the stat6250/course_questions_wiki repo as the base fork and

- the week-5 branch of your version of the repo as the head fork.

The instructor will then review the pull request and make comments should further revision be needed. Then, after the contents of the pull request have been finalized without any merge conflicts, the instructor will merge the pull request.
