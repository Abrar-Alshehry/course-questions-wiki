## Week 9 Quiz Questions and Answers

In order to prepare your Week 9 Quiz submission, please edit ***this*** document to provide substantive questions for each Quiz Problem and SAS Recipe listed below, as well as answers to at least three questions raised.

All edits should conform to GitHub Markdown specifications (https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) and should be committed to a branch named "week-9" in your fork of this repo. Then, after all edits have been made/committed, your Week 9 Quiz should be submitted by initiating a pull request using

- the master branch of the stat6250/course_questions_wiki repo as the base fork and

- the week-9 branch of your version of the repo as the head fork.

The instructor will then review the pull request and make comments should further revision be needed. Then, after the contents of the pull request have been finalized without any merge conflicts, the instructor will merge the pull request.

[Course Textbook Chapter 14, Problem 8]
- Question (yzhu12-stat6250): Why the start value must be greater than the stop value when you decrement a DO loop by specifying a negative value for the BY clause? What kind of error will occur if the request is not fulfilled?
- *Question* (lwang30-stat6250) : When is the condition evaluated respectively in other DO loop statements ?



[Course Textbook Chapter 14, Problem 9]
- Question (yzhu12-stat6250): How can you specify that how many times that a DO loop executes?
- Answer (yzhu12-stat6250): You can specify how many times a DO loop executes by listing items in a series.
- *Question* (lwang30-stat6250) : Are DO While and DO Until statements complementary to each other ?



[Course Textbook Chapter 14, Problem 10]
- Question (yzhu12-stat6250): How to construct an iterative DO loop?
- Answer (yzhu12-stat6250): By specifying an index variable and the conditions that will execute the loop. 
- *Question* (lwang30-stat6250) : What would the statement be if DO Until is used in this case ? 



[Course Textbook Chapter 15, Problem 1]
- Question (yzhu12-stat6250): What will happen if you using the name of a SAS function as an array name?
- Answer (yzhu12-stat6250): The array will be correct, but you won't be able to use the function in the same DATA step, and a warning will be written to the SAS log.
- *Question* (lwang30-stat6250) : What statements can be described as "executable" ?



[Course Textbook Chapter 15, Problem 2]
- Question (yzhu12-stat6250): How can you indicate the dimension of a one-dimensional array?
- Answer (yzhu12-stat6250): You can indicate the dimension of a one-dimensional array with an asterisk (*) as long as you specify the elements of the array. 
- *Question* (lwang30-stat6250) : What other syntax can be used to define this array ?

[Course Textbook Chapter 15, Problem 5]
- Question (yzhu12-stat6250): You can create temporary array elements for DATA step processing without creating additional variables, but what step you must take then?
- Answer (yzhu12-stat6250): You need to specify _TEMPORARY_ after the array name and dimension.

[Course Textbook Chapter 15, Problem 6]
- Question (yzhu12-stat6250): Why do we have to enclose each value in quotation marks when assigning initial values to character variables? Which error will occur if we fail to do so?

- *Question* (lwang30-stat6250) : How many iterations does this do loop process ?



[Course Textbook Chapter 15, Problem 8]
- Question (yzhu12-stat6250): Why you don't have to re-specify the stop value of a DO statement if you change the dimension of the array when you use the DIM function?

[Course Textbook Chapter 15, Problem 9]
- Question (yzhu12-stat6250): What is the purpose of a SAS array?
- Answer (yzhu12-stat6250): An array is a temporary grouping of variables under a single name. This can reduce the number of statements needed to process variables and can simplify the maintenance of DATA step programs.
