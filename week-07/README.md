## Week 7 Quiz Questions and Answers

In order to prepare your Week 7 Quiz submission, please edit ***this*** document to provide substantive questions for each Quiz Problem and SAS Recipe listed below, as well as answers to at least three questions raised.

All edits should conform to GitHub Markdown specifications (https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) and should be committed to a branch named "week-7" in your fork of this repo. Then, after all edits have been made/committed, your Week 7 Quiz should be submitted by initiating a pull request using

- the master branch of the stat6250/course_questions_wiki repo as the base fork and

- the week-7 branch of your version of the repo as the head fork.

The instructor will then review the pull request and make comments should further revision be needed. Then, after the contents of the pull request have been finalized without any merge conflicts, the instructor will merge the pull request.

[Course Textbook Chapter 10, Problem 2]
- Question (mcardoso3-stat6250):  Does the 'Amount' label cover only numeric variables?



[Course Textbook Chapter 10, Problem 6]
- Question (mcardoso3-stat6250):  How many different ways are there of writing an IF-THEN statement in SAS?



[Course Textbook Chapter 10, Problem 7]
- Question (mcardoso3-stat6250):  How long can a new variable be by using the LENGTH statement?



[Course Textbook Chapter 10, Problem 8]
- Question (mcardoso3-stat6250):  What is the benefit of using ELSE in an IF-THEN statement?
 +- Answer (mcardoso3-stat6250):  In a IF-THEN statement with ELSE, SAS executes IF-THEN statements until it encounters the first true statment.



[Course Textbook Chapter 10, Problem 9]
- Question (mcardoso3-stat6250):  Is there a limit to including how many LENGTH statements you type in SAS?



[Course Textbook Chapter 10, Problem 10]
- Question (mcardoso3-stat6250):  What are the possible errors that you can commit while writing a LENGTH, INFILE, or IF-THEN statement?



[Course Textbook Chapter 11, Problem 1]
- Question (mcardoso3-stat6250):  Is it required to have both the DROP and KEEP data set options within the same statement?
 +- Answer (mcardoso3-stat6250):  If certain variables are not referenced, you can use the DROP= option in the SET statement, which doesn't require yo to use the KEEP= option.



[Course Textbook Chapter 11, Problem 2]
- Question (mcardoso3-stat6250):  Will the new data set being created always come before the previous data set has ben specified?



[Course Textbook Chapter 11, Problem 3]
- Question (mcardoso3-stat6250):  Why is there no 'middle' variable in each BY group?



[Course Textbook Chapter 11, Problem 8]
- Question (mcardoso3-stat6250):  How would continous looping happen when submitting a program?
 +- Answer (mcardoso3-stat6250):  The POINT= option reads only specified observations, so SAS can't read an end-of-file indicator as it would if the file was read sequentially.



[Course Textbook Chapter 11, Problem 9]
- Question (mcardoso3-stat6250):  How soon would observations be revealed when the DATA step has been executed?



[basic_recipe_for_combining_data_vertically (from Week 7 Overview)]
- Question (mcardoso3-stat6250):  Why would a length statement need to appear when creating wider character variable?



[optional: adv_recipe_for_combining_data_vertically (from Week 7 Overview)]
- Question (mcardoso3-stat6250):  What would be the best option to combine datasets in SAS?
