## Course Structure Quiz Problems

This document should be edited to provide substantive questions for each Quiz Problem and SAS Recipe listed below, as well as answers to at least three questions raised.

All edits should conform to GitHub Markdown specifications (https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) and should be committed to a branch named "week-02" in your fork of this repo. Then, after all edits have been made/committed, your Week 2 Quiz should be submitted by initiating a pull request using

- the master branch of the stat6250/course_questions_wiki repo as the base fork and

- the week-02 branch of your version of the repo as the head fork.

The instructor will then review the pull request and make comments should further revision be needed. Then, after the contents of the pull request have been finalized without any merge conflicts, the instructor will merge the pull request.

- Question (yyan11−stat6250): What are Numeric variables?
- Answer (yyan11−stat6250): Numeric variables, such as Policy and Total (shown below), can contain only
numeric values (the digits 0 through 9, +, -, ., and E for scientific notation).

- Question (yyan11−stat6250): Does the YEARCUTOFF= option affectdate values that have four-digit years?
- Answer (yyan11−stat6250): No, the YEARCUTOFF= option doesn't affect date values that have four-digit years.


[Course Textbook Chapter 2, Problem 7]
- Question (yyan11−stat6250): How long are Librefs?

- Question (yyan11−stat6250): How the YEARCUTOFF= Option Works?
- Answer (yyan11−stat6250): When a two-digit year value is read, SAS interprets it based on a 100-year span that starts with the YEARCUTOFF= value. 


[Course Textbook Chapter 2, Problem 9]
