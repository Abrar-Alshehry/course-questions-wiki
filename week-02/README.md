## Week 2 Quiz Questions and Answers

In order to prepare your Week 2 Quiz submission, please edit ***this*** document to provide substantive questions for each Quiz Problem and SAS Recipe listed below, as well as answers to at least three questions raised.

All edits should conform to GitHub Markdown specifications (https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) and should be committed to a branch named "week-2" in your fork of this repo. Then, after all edits have been made/committed, your Week 2 Quiz should be submitted by initiating a pull request using

- the master branch of the stat6250/course_questions_wiki repo as the base fork and

- the week-2 branch of your version of the repo as the head fork.

The instructor will then review the pull request and make comments should further revision be needed. Then, after the contents of the pull request have been finalized without any merge conflicts, the instructor will merge the pull request.

[Course Textbook Chapter 1, Problem 1]
* *Question (aalshehry−stat6250):* Wht is themaximum number of observations per dataset? What about variables/columns?
- Question (lzhao4−stat6250): Do missing values affect the structure of the data set?
- Question (akumar30−stat6250): Does missing value has any impact on total number of observation or variables in SAS Datasets?


[Course Textbook Chapter 1, Problem 2]
* *Question (aalshehry−stat6250):* Why should we use “run;” steatment many times within SAS program instead of one time at the end?
* *Answer (aalshehry−stat6250):* The "run;" statement is often not strictly required, as SAS will assume you want to start a new step when it sees data or proc. However your code will be clearer and easier to understand if you make the end of each step explicit.
- Question (lzhao4−stat6250): Add run statement after each program step is an essential?character variable is valid when contains letters and underscores.
- Question (akumar30−stat6250): What is the default sorting format in SAS and how to format multiple variables in different sorting order?


[Course Textbook Chapter 1, Problem 3]
* *Question (aalshehry−stat6250):* How many type of variables does SAS support?
- Question (lzhao4−stat6250): Can numeric variable contains letter and underscore?
- Answer (lzhao4−stat6250): A numeric variable can only contain numeric values. A 
- Question (akumar30−stat6250): If a character variable contains only numeric data, can we changed the variable type in SAS from character to numeric?
- Answer (akumar30−stat6250): A variable can be defined as only one type, so you cannot use the same variable name to convert the values. You create a new variable with the values converted using input function.



[Course Textbook Chapter 1, Problem 4]
* *Question (aalshehry−stat6250):* How to represent missing data in SAS dataset?
- Question (lzhao4−stat6250): Can missing value indicates a different type of variable?
- Question (akumar30−stat6250): How to distinguish between different types of missing values (e.g missing values because of non-response or missing values because of invalid data entry)?
- Answer (akumar30−stat6250):  In SAS, letters A-Z and underscore "_" to indicate the type of missing values.



[Course Textbook Chapter 1, Problem 5]
* *Question (aalshehry−stat6250):* Can a character variable begins with a number?
- Question (lzhao4−stat6250): What is the basic rule to set a valid variable name in SAS?
- Question (akumar30−stat6250): What is the maximum size of character data type variables? 
- Answer (akumar30−stat6250): Character variables can be up to 32,767 bytes long.



[Course Textbook Chapter 1, Problem 8]
* *Question (aalshehry−stat6250):* Considering all numeric variables have a default length of 8 bytes, what is the maximum value that can SAS accept for a numeric variable?
* *Answer (aalshehry−stat6250):* 
![8 byte](https://github.com/aalshehry-stat6250/course-questions-wiki/blob/Week-2/week-02/8byte.JPG?raw=true)
- Question (lzhao4−stat6250): No matter a numeric variable contains how many digits it has a default length of 8?
- Answer (lzhao4−stat6250): Numeric variable balance always has a default length of 8 unless you set a specific length.
- Question (akumar30−stat6250):  What is the default length of numeric variables?
- Answer (akumar30−stat6250): All numeric variables have a default length of 8 bytes.



[Course Textbook Chapter 2, Problem 3]
* *Question (aalshehry−stat6250):* Where and how to use YEARCUTOFF option?
- Question (lzhao4−stat6250):  YEARCUTOFF= option has no effect in some cases?
- Answer (lzhao4−stat6250): The YEARCUTOFF= option has no effect when processing dates with four-digits years, processing dates already stored as SAS date values, and displaying dates with SAS date formats.
- Question (akumar30−stat6250):  What is the default value of YEARCUTOFF option in SAS for two-digit year?
- Answer (akumar30−stat6250): The default value of YEARCUTOFF= is 1920.



[Course Textbook Chapter 2, Problem 7]
* *Question (aalshehry−stat6250):* How to save your dataset in the permanent library?
- Question (lzhao4−stat6250): How to correctly assign a SAS libref?
- Question (akumar30−stat6250): Doe dataset saved in permanent library accessible after end of SAS Session?


[Course Textbook Chapter 2, Problem 8]
* *Question (aalshehry−stat6250):* Without using the YEARCUTOFF= option, how would SAS interpret 11/11/20? Is it 1920 or 2020?
* *Answer (aalshehry−stat6250):* The default value of YEARCUTOFF= is 1920.
- Question (lzhao4−stat6250): How does YEARCUTOFF= option work on the interpretation of two-digits years?
- Question (akumar30−stat6250): Does YEARCUTOFF option in SAS has any impact on a date value that contains four digit year?


[Course Textbook Chapter 2, Problem 9]
* *Question (aalshehry−stat6250):* If a SAS session is ended or a libref is deleted, does the library still exist?
* **Answer (aalshehry−stat6250): In these cases, SAS no longer has access to the files in the library.
- Question (lzhao4−stat6250): Libref exists only during the session in which it is created?
- Question (akumar30−stat6250): What is the default default libref for a temporary SAS data library?
- Answer (akumar30−stat6250): Work is the libref for a temporary SAS data library

[basic_recipe_for_loading_data_from_remote_Excel_file (from Week 2 Overview)]
* *Question (aalshehry−stat6250):* Is it mandatory to use “filename tempfile clear;” step? Why?
- Question (lzhao−stat6250): Do we possible to transfer data from SAS dataset to an excel file? How? 
- Question (akumar30−stat6250):  What type of files are supported using proc http statement in SAS?
