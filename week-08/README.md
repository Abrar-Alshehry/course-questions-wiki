[Course Textbook Chapter 13, Problem 1]
- Question (yzhu12-stat6250): What will happen if the SUBSTR function is on the left side of an assignment? How about on the right side of an assignment?
- Answer (yzhu12-stat6250): When the SUBSTR function is on the left side of an assignment statement, it replaces variable values. When SUBSTR is on the right side of an assignment statement, it extracts variable values. 
- Question (akumar30−stat6250): What will be the output of mean function if all arguments has missing values?

[Course Textbook Chapter 13, Problem 2]
- Question (yzhu12-stat6250): What statement do we use if we want to ensure that all forms of a character string are found?
- Answer (yzhu12-stat6250): We can use the UPCASE or LOWCASE function with the INDEX function.
- Question (akumar30−stat6250): Can I use character variable to a function that requires numeric arguments?
- Answer (akumar30−stat6250): Yes, Automatic character-to-numeric conversion occurs when a character value is specified in a function that requires numeric arguments.
- *Question* (lwang30-stat6250) : Can SAS automatically convert numeric variable to character variable as well ?

- Answer (hhu9−stat6250): I think PayRate is also represented by numeric values, Log will show a massage that a  conversion has occurred.
- Question (meisenbach-stat6250): Why should you not rely on automatic conversion?
- Answer (meisenbach-stat6250): Sometimes SAS is unable to do the conversion (e.g. the PayRate contains a dollar sign).
- Question (rluo-stat6250): What is the target variables?
- Answer (rluo-stat6250): A target variable is the variable to whic the result of a function is assigned.
- Question (nly13-stat6250): When a numeric operation is involved, why does SAS automatically convert character variables to numeric?
- Question (yyan11−stat6250): Does SAS convert character values to numeric values?
- Answer (yyan11−stat6250): By default, if you reference a character variable in a numeric context such as an arithmetic operation, SAS tries to convert the variable values to numeric.



[Course Textbook Chapter 13, Problem 3]

- Answer (rluo-stat6250): INPUT function converts character data values to numeric values.
- Question (nly13-stat6250): Does the width in an INFORMAT read the comma?
- Question (yyan11−stat6250): What happens if skip the INPUT function or the PUT function when converting data?
- Answer (yyan11−stat6250): SAS will detect the mismatched variables and will try an automatic character-to-numeric or numeric-to-character conversion. However, this process doesn't always work. Therefore, it is always best to include INPUT and PUT functions in your programs to avoid data type mismatches and circumvent automatic conversion.

The INDEX function searches values from left to right, looking for the first occurrence of the string. It returns the position of the string's first character; if the string is not found, it returns a value of 0.



[recipe_for_isolating_all_duplicates (from Week 8 Overview)]
- Question (yzhu12-stat6250): In the example, the code first*School_Code*last*School_Code=0 is used to ensure that if and only if a value of School_Code only appears exactly once in a dataset. So why doesn't it has the same code to analysis the County_Code and District_Code?
